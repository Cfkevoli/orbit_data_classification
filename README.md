# Orbit Data Classification

This project aims to classify asteroids into their respective orbit types based on data sourced from Kaggle.

Source of the data: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamshandilya/orbit-data-for-all-known-asteroids-in-mpc-database

This project aims to assess the performance of two neural network architectures in a multiclass classification problem,
specifically to classify the orbit types of asteroids. The two architectures evaluated in this study are a simple sequential
dense neural network and a wide neural network. The code can be accessed from the file "Code" and a report labelled "Report" details 
the problem statement, exploratory data analysis, and model construction.
